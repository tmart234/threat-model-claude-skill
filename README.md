# threat-modeler

A Claude skill that produces structured hybrid threat models (contextual / operational / strategic) for software, systems, IoT/embedded, medical devices, and business processes.

See `SKILL.md` for the full skill body, `references/` for on-demand methodology details, and `assets/threat-model-template.md` for a blank template.

## Install

The skill name (in `SKILL.md` frontmatter) is `threat-modeler`. Anthropic's convention is that the skill directory name matches the skill name, so install this repository under that directory:

```sh
# user-scoped
git clone https://github.com/tmart234/threat-model-claude-skill ~/.claude/skills/threat-modeler

# project-scoped
git clone https://github.com/tmart234/threat-model-claude-skill .claude/skills/threat-modeler
```

If you cloned with the default directory name (`threat-model-claude-skill/`), rename it to `threat-modeler/` so the skill loader picks it up.
